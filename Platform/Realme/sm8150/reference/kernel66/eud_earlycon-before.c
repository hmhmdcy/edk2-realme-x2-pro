/*
 * Early console over the Qualcomm Embedded USB Debugger (EUD) COM peripheral.
 *
 * EUD is a debug hub that takes over the USB port and exposes a small set of
 * USB devices to a host PC, one of which is a transmit-only COM FIFO.  It is a
 * register FIFO and not an 8250 compatible UART, so the generic
 * earlycon=uart,mmio,... path cannot drive it.  This driver stays small on
 * purpose: no baud rate, no line control, no receive path.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     earlycon=eud,mmio,0x88e0000
 *
 * The host reassembles the [ID][LEN][DATA] frames, so run eudtool com-up and a
 * frame reassembler on the PC before booting the device.
 *
 * The register semantics come from the downstream Android driver
 * drivers/soc/qcom/eud.c, which is the reference for this hardware.
